# Weatherapp
My version of the Weatherapp. Because of my time constraints I didn't have as much time as I wanted to use on this project. There were lot's of new things for me, Docker and React in particular, that I only had time to get a taste of. I will definitely take a deeper look on them.

Parts I focused on were Docker, Node and React.

On front end I had trouble getting bootstrap working. The problem had something to do with webpacket. In the end, I had to drop trying to make the site look at least decent.
